## DESCRIPTION
A simple landing page on some of the amazing Kenyan Track Athletes. A self challenge to only use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## KEY FEATURES
This landing page was a project undertaken to practice and review some HTML and CSS concepts.
I plan on updating it in the future (possibly with an API that provides the athlete data as well as incorporate dark mode and light mode). 
Currently, the key features and concepts I worked on include:
- Using responsive cards that work on any screen
- Using absolute positioning to overlay text above each athlete's card
- Text overlays only appear on hover for each card
- Incorporating email sending using EmailJS
- Back to Top Button

## SETUP
* Clone this repository to your machine.
* Navigate to the project directory, open the project in an IDE of your choice. (In my case: Visual Studio Code.)
* With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the Go Live button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with Live Server.
* Browse the website and feel free to send feedback on the website design at your discretion. 

## CHALLENGES
* How to hide sensitive information because environment variables (.env files) are not natively supported in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS projects.
